# Car Demo

## Information
---
Car Demo is a demo that shows the 3D rendering capabilities of Dolphin. It was shown at SpaceWorld 2000. This demos is also available within the files of the Nintendo GameCube Service Disc. It features a 1:35 music track to go along with the demo. The internal name for this demo is `cardemo.dol`. Source code for this demo is included in the Dolphin SDK. The August 11th, 2000 version of this demo may be the one that was shown at SpaceWorld, as it's commit note states ``final checkin for spaceworld``. The date lines up with the time of SpaceWorld 2000, as it took place on August 24th through August 26th. The version info is based off of dates found within the source code. 

In footage taken by Kikizo recovered by Adam Doree, there appears to be Japenese voiceover on top of the demo. Further research into this if possible.

Images of the unit began surfacing on December 18th, 2018, when **Person 1** began a direct message conversion with **Person 2**. They began discussing TWL development hardware, and eventually **Person 2** asked **Person 1** if they owned any TWL development hardware. **Person 2** replied with a few images ``(/img/Person 2 DM)`` regarding that he owned a "weird looking DSi".

**Person 2** eventually took the unit apart, looking to gather more info on it ``(img/Person 2 Teardown``). Board markings confirmed this was a prototype, as seen by the *X* in the board revision marks.

Around May of 2019, the console sold for $750 USD to **Person 3**. They eventually made a full dump of the unit a few days later, using an exploit in one of the pre-installed developer apps.
